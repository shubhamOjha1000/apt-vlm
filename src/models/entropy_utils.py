"""Utilities for computing and visualizing patch-wise entropy in images.

This module provides functions for:
1. Computing entropy maps for different patch sizes in images using vectorized operations
2. Selecting patches based on entropy thresholds for mixed-resolution processing
3. Visualizing the selected patches with different sizes

The main components are:
- compute_patch_entropy_vectorized: Efficiently computes entropy for multiple patch sizes
- select_patches_by_threshold: Selects patches of different sizes based on entropy threshold
- visualize_selected_patches_cv2: Visualizes the selected patches using OpenCV

These utilities are particularly useful for mixed-resolution image processing where
different regions of an image can be processed at different scales based on their
information content (entropy).
